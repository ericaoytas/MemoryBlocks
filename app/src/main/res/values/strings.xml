        Before playing, you have to set the difficulty of your game. The difficulty
        determines the size of your memory block grid.

    <string name="pattern_explain_help_string">
        A pattern will be automatically displayed on the memory block grid as the blocks
        turn to the color blue. The first pattern will always start with one single,
        random block. Every time the player mimics the pattern correctly, one random block
        is added to the end of the pattern.
    </string>
    <string name="mimic_help_string">2. Mimic the pattern</string>
    <string name="mimic_explain_string">
        The player must try to replicate the pattern that they observed by clicking
        on the correct blocks in the correct order. When the player pressed the correct
        block, the block will turn blue. Once a pattern is successfully replicated, points
        will be added to the player\'s score. If the player presses an incorrect block, the
        score will reset to zero, and a new pattern will be played. You cannot press a block
        while a pattern is showing.

        During the game, there will be "Replay Pattern" button found at the bottom of the
        screen. If the player needs to see the pattern again, they may click this button
        to play it on the board again.
