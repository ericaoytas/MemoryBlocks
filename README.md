## How To Play
1. **Observe the pattern**: 
A pattern will be automatically displayed on the memory block grid as the blocks turn to the color blue. The first pattern will always start with one single, random block. Every time the player mimics the pattern correctly, one random block is added to the end of the pattern.

2. **Mimic the pattern**: 
The player must try to replicate the pattern that they observed by clicking on the correct blocks in the correct order. When the player pressed the correct block, the block will turn blue. Once a pattern is successfully replicated, points will be added to the player's score. If the player presses an incorrect block, the score will reset to zero, and a new pattern will be played. The player cannot press a block while a pattern is showing.

3. **Replay the pattern for help**: 
During the game, there will be a "Replay Pattern" button found at the bottom of the screen. If the player needs to see the pattern again, they may click this button to replay it on the board.
